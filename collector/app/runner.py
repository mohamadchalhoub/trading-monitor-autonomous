# ISOLATION (revised 2026-09-13 — this used to be a disclosed trade-off
# instead of a fix; live evidence made that no longer acceptable). The same
# live diagnosis found copy_ticks_range/copy_ticks_from can each take up to
# ~106s to hard-fail. Originally this ran inline in the main loop, so a
# failing tick call froze snapshot/candle/trade-sync AND the shutdown-signal
# check for the full ~106s every time it happened. It now runs on its own
# background thread (see _maybe_start_tick_sync), serialized against the
# main loop's own MT5 calls with `_mt5_call_lock` — the MetaTrader5 Python
# module is documented as not thread-safe for concurrent calls on one
# connection, so true parallel MT5 calls are never allowed, but the main
# loop only does a NON-BLOCKING lock attempt: if tick sync is mid-call, the
# main loop skips that one ~poll_interval_seconds cycle's MT5 work and
# checks again next cycle, rather than blocking synchronously for the
# tick call's entire duration. Net effect: the loop keeps cycling and stays
# responsive to shutdown throughout a slow/failing tick call, and normal
