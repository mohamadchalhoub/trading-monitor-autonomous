/**
 * OFF / SHADOW / DEMO control for the trend-breakout strategy, read fresh
 * from the environment on every check — same "never cache a
 * safety-relevant read" posture as `../gold-execution/gold-execution-mode.ts`
 * and `../autonomous/kill-switch.ts` — never `.env`-cached at import time,
 * so an operator can flip it without restarting anything that reads it
 * lazily. Deliberately separate from gold's own `GOLD_EXECUTION_MODE` and
 * EURUSD legacy autonomous's own switch — every strategy's activation
 * switch must never be coupled to another's.
 *
 * Covers BOTH trend-breakout instruments (EURUSD and XAUUSD) with a single
 * switch, not one per instrument — a shared "stop everything" lever is
 * safer to operate under incident pressure than remembering which
 * per-instrument file to touch, and both instruments are meant to go live
 * together.
 *
 * - OFF: no new entries, no order queued at all for either instrument.
 *   Protective monitoring of any already-open position (there should never
 *   be one while OFF, but if one exists from a prior mode, monitoring still
 *   applies) continues.
 * - SHADOW: full pipeline runs (signal -> risk gates) and every decision is
 *   logged exactly as if trading, but no order is ever queued for the
 *   collector to execute, and no instrument slot lock is claimed.
 * - DEMO: an approved decision is queued as a real PENDING order for the
 *   collector to pick up and place on the (positively verified) demo
 *   account. There is no fourth mode and no automatic real-account path —
 *   REAL is not a value this type can even hold.

 * callers must call this again right before queuing, not rely on a value
 * read earlier in the same cycle.
 *
 * Checks a file-based toggle in addition to the env var — the env var is
 * fixed at process start and cannot be flipped live without a restart, but
 * the dashboard's "stop/resume new entries" control needs a lever that
 * takes effect on the very next check. Either one being active is enough to
 * stop new entries.
