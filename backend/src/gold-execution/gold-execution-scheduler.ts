/**
 * Periodic, restart-safe invocation of the gold watch cycle — the piece
 * `gold-execution-watch.ts` (a manually-invoked single cycle) deliberately
 * did not provide, matching every other coordinator in this codebase's own
 * "built and tested ahead of its own scheduler" posture, but which the
 * task explicitly requires be built once that posture has been reviewed
 * and an explicit decision made to run continuously.
 *
 * Reuses `ProcessLock` from v1's own `watch.ts` (single-instance enforcement
 * — a lock held for the whole process lifetime, not per cycle) rather than
 * re-implementing it. Never crashes the loop on a single cycle's error —
 * every cycle is wrapped and logged; the interval keeps running.
 *
 * Kill switch and STOP NEW ENTRIES are NOT re-checked here separately —
 * they are already checked, fresh, on every call inside
 * `GoldExecutionCoordinatorService.evaluate()` (kill switch) and re-checked
 * immediately before every queue-send (STOP NEW ENTRIES) — this scheduler
 * only decides WHEN to run a cycle, never whether an individual decision
 * is allowed to proceed, so there is exactly one place either switch is
 * enforced, not two copies that could drift.
