/**
 * Re-verifies everything `GoldExecutionCoordinatorService.evaluate()` already
 * checked, ONE MORE TIME, at the actual hand-off to the collector — the
 * point closest this backend can get to the real broker-send boundary
 * without reaching into the Python executor. The task's own framing: "A
 * coordinator check before a DB write does not cover subsequent queue
 * delay." Concretely, everything between `evaluate()`'s DB write (PENDING)
 * and the collector's next poll (up to `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, plus
 * whatever backend/network hiccup) is currently unchecked — a decision
 * queued one second before the Beirut window closes, or before a kill
 * switch engages, or before price moves past the deviation tolerance,
 * would otherwise sail through untouched.
 *
 * Called by `GoldExecutionController.getPendingOrder` AFTER the atomic
 * PENDING -> SENT claim (so the collector cannot poll it again in the
 * meantime), but BEFORE it is handed to the collector to actually send.
 * On failure, the caller must cancel the claimed decision (mark it FAILED
 * with this reason) and return `{ order: null }` — never hand a
 * now-invalid order to the collector just because it was already claimed.
 *
 * Deliberately uses the freshest `LiveTick.tickAt` as its reference "now"
 * for the window/freshness checks below, rather than the backend process's
 * own wall clock: this ties the recheck to the most recent instant we
 * actually have real market information for (which in healthy operation is
 * within a few seconds of true wall time — the collector pushes a fresh
 * tick roughly every `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`), and it means a stale/absent
 * tick fails the check for an honest reason (see below) rather than the
 * check silently passing against a live process clock while the market
 * data behind it is actually stale.
