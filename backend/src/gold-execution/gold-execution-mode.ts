/**
 * OFF / SHADOW / DEMO control for the gold strategy, read fresh from the
 * environment on every check (same "never cache a safety-relevant read"
 * posture as autonomous/kill-switch.ts) — never `.env`-cached at import
 * time, so an operator can flip it without restarting anything that reads
 * it lazily. Deliberately separate from EURUSD's own
 * AUTONOMOUS_EXECUTION_ENABLED boolean — the two strategies' activation
 * switches must never be coupled.
 *
 * - OFF: no new entries, no order queued at all. Protective monitoring of
 *   any already-open position (there should never be one while OFF, but
 *   if one exists from a prior mode, monitoring still applies) continues.
 * - SHADOW: full pipeline runs (signal -> risk gate) and every decision is
 *   logged exactly as if trading, but no order is ever queued for the
 *   collector to execute.
 * - DEMO: an approved decision is queued as a real PENDING order for the
 *   collector to pick up and place on the (positively verified) demo
 *   account. There is no fourth mode and no automatic real-account path —
 *   REAL is not a value this type can even hold.
