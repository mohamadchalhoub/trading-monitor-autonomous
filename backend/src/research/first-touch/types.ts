/**
 * research/first-touch — PURE RESEARCH CODE, gold (XAUUSD) "first-touch"
 * hypothesis study.
 *
 * This module is deliberately isolated from every live trading strategy:
 * it has no import from, and no wiring to, `src/trend-breakout/` or
 * `src/autonomous/` (the one explicitly-approved exception is the pure
 * `getBeirutWallClock`/`BEIRUT_TIMEZONE` utility re-used from
 * `src/trend-breakout/schedule.ts` — see `engine.ts`). Nothing here reads
 * or writes the database; every function in this module operates only on
 * data explicitly passed in by the caller (synthetic fixtures in this
 * repo's tests, and — not yet implemented — real historical data in a
 * future study run). See `scripts/first-touch-study.ts`, which is a
 * deliberately-not-runnable stub until a level-selection method is
 * approved.
