 * path agrees: a real path may reverse direction more than once, and a
 * third, equally compatible path can disagree with both samples. Live
 * counterexample (BUY, touch 4340, TP 4350, SL 4330, O=4345 H=4352 L=4328
 * C=4348): both two-leg samples land on LOSS, yet
 * 4345 -> 4340 (entry) -> 4350 (TP) -> 4352 -> 4328 -> 4348 is equally
 * compatible with this OHLC row and resolves WIN. No finite sample of
 * paths can be exhaustive, so this function no longer samples paths at
 * all — it proves, directly from OHLC, which outcomes are REACHABLE by
 * ANY compatible path, via the following state-reachability argument
 * (stated here so the conditions below aren't "magic"):
 *
 * Normalize to a signed axis where the favorable direction (toward TP) is
 * always "larger" — this collapses BUY/SELL into one set of comparisons.
 * In this axis, sTouch always sits strictly between sSl and sTp (a
 * genuine mid-candle touch), and sOpen is always >= sTouch (this is a
 * structural fact of how the touch/approach direction is defined, not an
 * assumption). Call the extreme with the larger signed value
 * `favExtreme` (the real high for BUY, the real low for SELL) and the
 * other `advExtreme`.
 *
 * - `advExtreme` is UNREACHABLE before the touch: reaching it requires
 *   first crossing sTouch (it's on the opposite side), and the FIRST such
 *   crossing is, by definition, the touch itself. So advExtreme is
 *   necessarily visited by a post-touch continuation of the SAME leg the
 *   touch happens on, immediately available to any path — LOSS is
 *   therefore reachable whenever advExtreme is at/beyond SL (the
 *   continuation from touch to advExtreme necessarily passes through SL
 *   first, by the intermediate value theorem, if SL lies between them).
 * - `favExtreme` sits on the SAME side as the open. When there is real
 *   pre-touch room (sOpen > sTouch strictly), a path is always free to
 *   visit favExtreme entirely BEFORE the touch (a simple move from open
 *   further in its own direction, never needing to approach sTouch at
 *   all) — so WIN is reachable whenever favExtreme is at/beyond TP
 *   (route it immediately post-touch instead), and INDEPENDENTLY, a
 *   "nothing happens" continuation is reachable whenever favExtreme CAN
 *   be relegated pre-touch and the close itself never reaches TP (route
 *   post-touch as touch -> advExtreme -> close directly, skipping
 *   favExtreme entirely since it was already used pre-touch).
 * - When there is no pre-touch room (open == touch, or this candle is
 *   already fully after entry), favExtreme cannot be relegated — it will
 *   be visited post-touch in EVERY path, so "nothing happens" is only
 *   reachable when favExtreme itself never reaches TP.
 *
 * More than one reachable outcome (the same candle admits a compatible
 * path to each) is genuine ambiguity — not a sampling gap, a proof that
 * OHLC alone cannot decide it. Exactly one reachable outcome is a
 * genuine, provable determinate result.

   * candle is then checked exactly like any other candle by the main loop
   * below — OPEN first (resolves immediately if the reopen print alone
   * already lies beyond a boundary), then high/low, then AMBIGUOUS only if
   * the open was neutral and the range still straddles both. An
