/**
 * Operator controls for `xauusd-m1-rsi-retest-extremes-v1`: execution mode,
 * kill switch, and the stop-new-entries pause.
 *
 * Every check reads fresh from disk or the environment on every call and is
 * never cached at import time — a safety control an operator flips must take
 * effect on the very next check, not on the next restart.
 *
 * Spec §10 says to PRESERVE the existing gold pause and kill-switch controls,
 * so this module honours the established `GOLD_KILL_SWITCH` /
 * `GOLD_STOP_NEW_ENTRIES` files as well as its own strategy-scoped ones.
 * Either source being active is enough to block. That means the operator's
 * existing habits and the existing `stop-gold-demo.ps1` script keep working
 * against the new strategy, and it fails in the safe direction: adding a
 * control can only ever stop more, never less.

/**
 * DEMO and LIVE are symmetric, not a demo mode plus an unguarded escape

 * `trade_mode` (DEMO→DEMO, LIVE→REAL) before an order is ever queued — see
 * `getRsiRequiredTradeMode` and the check in `risk-manager.ts`/
 * `decision.service.ts`. A config value can select which account family is
 * intended, but it can never itself cause an order against the other kind of
 * account — the live re-check of the account's own reported trade_mode is
 * what actually gates the send, every time, independent of this setting.
 *
 * - `OFF`   — no evaluation, no orders. Protective monitoring, reconciliation
 *             and Friday liquidation of owned positions still run.
 * - `SHADOW`— the full pipeline runs and every decision is recorded exactly
 *             as if trading, but nothing is ever queued for the broker.
 * - `DEMO`  — an approved decision is queued as a real order, but only once
 *             the connected account is positively verified as DEMO.
 * - `LIVE`  — an approved decision is queued as a real order against real
 *             money, but only once the connected account is positively
 *             verified as REAL.
