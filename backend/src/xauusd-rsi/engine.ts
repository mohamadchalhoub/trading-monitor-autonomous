/**
 * The live observation engine: ordered market observations in, consumed
 * signals out. Still pure — no database, no HTTP, no clock of its own —
 * so every ordering, duplicate, gap, warm-up and rollover case is testable
 * directly.
 *
 * ## Why closed bars and ticks enter through different doors
 *
 * The RSI's recursive Wilder state is advanced ONLY by completed M1 bars
 * (`applyClosedBar`), which come from the broker's own candle data. Ticks
 * (`applyTick`) never advance it; they only set the forming bar's current
 * price, from which `projectRsi` derives the intrabar value. This is spec
 * §8.1's requirement that a tick must not be treated as its own RSI period,
 * and it has a useful property: replaying the same tick twice, or receiving
 * ten ticks in a second instead of one, cannot change the indicator.
 *
 * ## Price basis
 *
 * RSI is computed on **bid**, because that is what an MT5 gold chart plots
 * by default and therefore what the screenshots' RSI(5) was computed from.
 * Execution pricing is a separate concern and correctly uses ask for buys
 * and bid for sells — see the coordinator. Mixing the two would shift every
 * threshold by the spread.
 *
 * ## Observation mode
 *
 * `TICK` means genuine ordered broker ticks. `SAMPLED_INTRABAR` means the
 * engine is being fed periodic quote samples rather than every tick, which
 * spec §7 requires be labelled as such and disclosed, because a crossing
 * that occurs and reverses entirely between two samples is invisible. The
 * engine never treats "no crossing observed" as proof no crossing happened.
