/**
 * Turns an engine signal into either a queued order or a recorded skip.
 *
 * Every outcome writes a row. A signal blocked by the schedule, by
 * occupancy, by risk or by a control is recorded with `orderStatus: NONE`
 * and a `skipReason`, because spec §12 requires skipped events be reportable
 * with their reasons, and spec §9.5 requires a blocked signal be consumed
 * rather than queued for later. Nothing is ever deferred to a queue that
 * might drain after the block lifts.
 *
 * Has no scheduler of its own by design — something else must call
 * `evaluate()` with a real signal. It is never invoked speculatively.
