/**
 * One watch cycle: reconcile, recover, observe, decide.
 *
 * Ordering inside a cycle is deliberate and is itself a requirement:
 *
 *   1. **Friday liquidation first.** Protective closure of owned exposure
 *      takes precedence over opening anything (spec §10), and it must run
 *      even when pauses or kill switches are blocking entries.
 *   2. **Recovery before trading.** A restart re-establishes continuity and
 *      reconciles persisted decisions against real broker exposure before a
 *      single entry may be submitted.
 *   3. **Reseed before observing.** The indicator is rebuilt from broker
 *      candle history when it is cold, without emitting anything for the
 *      historical bars it walks through.
 *   4. **Observe, then decide.** Ticks are replayed in order through the pure
 *      engine; whatever it emits is handed to the coordinator.
 *
 * The cycle never throws its way out of the loop: a failure is reported and
 * the next cycle tries again. Uncertain submissions are reconciled rather
 * than retried blindly.
