/**
 * The independent, deterministic risk gate for
 * `xauusd-m1-rsi-retest-extremes-v1`.
 *
 * Pure: every input is passed in, nothing is read from a database, a clock
 * or the environment, so every rejection path is directly testable.
 *
 * Deliberately re-checks things the coordinator has already checked. That
 * duplication is the point — this is the last deterministic gate before a
 * decision is allowed to become a queued order, and it must not depend on
 * an earlier layer having done its job.
 *
 * It NEVER adjusts an order to make it acceptable. Every failure is a
 * rejection: volume is never resized, the $5 bracket is never widened to
 * satisfy a broker stops level, and risk is never sized down to fit a cap.
 * Spec §10 is explicit about this, and silently "fixing" an order would
 * mean executing something the rules never described.
