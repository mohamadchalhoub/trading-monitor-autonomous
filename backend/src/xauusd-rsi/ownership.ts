/**
 * Who owns which XAUUSD position, and on what terms.
 *
 * Spec §2 and §10 require that migrating to the new strategy must not change
 * what happens to positions the OLD strategies opened: they keep their
 * original identity, their original protective distances, and their original
 * management, until they resolve on their own. A single shared registry is
 * what makes that enforceable rather than aspirational — every worker that
 * touches a position looks its magic number up here instead of assuming
 * "gold position, therefore mine".
 *
 * A position whose magic number is not listed here is FOREIGN: a manual
 * trade, another system's, or an unknown. Foreign exposure is displayed and
 * counted for occupancy (so the application never opens a second position
 * alongside one), but is never closed, never modified, and never adopted.
