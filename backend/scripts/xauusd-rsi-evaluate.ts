/**
 * Historical evaluation of `xauusd-m1-rsi-retest-extremes-v1`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run xauusd-rsi:evaluate
 *   npm run xauusd-rsi:evaluate -- --from 2024-03-01 --to 2026-09-16
 *   npm run xauusd-rsi:evaluate -- --json report.json
 *
 * ## What this can and cannot establish
 *
 * The strategy is INTRABAR. It reacts to RSI crossing a level at the moment
 * it happens, within a forming M1 bar. Closed M1 OHLC does not contain that
 * information: it records where price opened, how far it travelled, and
 * where it closed, but not the path it took. From closed bars alone it is
 * impossible to know whether RSI dipped below 82 mid-bar and invalidated a
 * pattern, or exactly when a crossing occurred.
 *
 * So this script runs TWO clearly separated observation models and never
 * blends them:
 *
 *   1. `TICK_REPLAY` — genuine ordered broker ticks, replayed through the
 *      SAME engine the live path uses. This is a faithful reproduction of
 *      live behaviour, and it is only available where tick coverage exists.
 *
 *   2. `CLOSED_M1_APPROXIMATION` — RSI recomputed on closed-bar closes, with
 *      one observation per bar. This is a DIFFERENT strategy from the live
 *      one: it cannot see intrabar invalidation, it cannot see a crossing
 *      that reverses within a bar, and its entry timing is bar-quantised.
 *      Its numbers are reported as an approximation under a different
 *      observation model, never as a backtest of the live strategy.
 *
 * Exit resolution has its own irreducible uncertainty: when a single M1 bar's
 * range contains BOTH the take-profit and the stop-loss, closed OHLC cannot
 * say which was touched first. Those trades are counted as `INDETERMINATE`
 * and reported separately. They are never resolved by assuming the
 * favourable order, and never silently dropped.
 *
 * No parameter here is tuned, no filter is added, and nothing is reported
 * selectively. The spec was frozen and committed before this script ran.

/**
 * Cost assumptions, stated rather than buried.
 *
 * ## How the spread is accounted for — corrected
 *
 * An earlier revision subtracted the spread from each trade's P&L. That was
 * wrong, because it deducted a cost that the entry and exit prices already
 * express. The spread is not a fee taken off the result; it is the reason the
 * market must travel further before a target is reached.
 *
 * The model now uses executable prices directly. MT5 gold charts are BID
 * based, so every OHLC value here is a bid:
 *
 *   BUY  enters at the ask (bid + spread) and exits at the bid. Its $5
 *        take-profit sits 5 above the ask, so the BID must travel
 *        5 + spread to reach it, and only 5 - spread to be stopped out.
 *   SELL enters at the bid and exits at the ask. Its $5 take-profit sits 5
 *        below the entry bid measured in ask terms, so again the bid must
 *        travel further to win than to lose.
 *
 * A resolved trade therefore realises exactly +/-$5 per ounce, and the
 * spread's cost shows up where it actually occurs: in how often the target is
 * reached at all. Nothing is deducted twice, and nothing is deducted that the
 * prices do not already contain.
 *
 * The spread figure itself is this deployment's own observed XAUUSD quote.
 * Two values are reported because it varies materially with session: $0.18
 * was observed during liquid hours and $0.43 at the Sunday reopening.
