# Phase 11 — Phase 0 §26: nightly logical pg_dump, 30-day rolling retention
# plus roughly one monthly snapshot kept longer. Runs pg_dump INSIDE the
# Postgres container (docker exec) so it works identically in dev and
# production — no local pg_dump binary or client/server version-matching
# needed on whatever host is doing the backing up.
#
# Usage: ./backup.sh   (reads POSTGRES_CONTAINER/POSTGRES_USER/POSTGRES_DB/
#                        BACKUP_DIR env vars, all optional — dev defaults below)

# Retention: delete daily dumps older than 30 days, except one taken on the
# 1st of its month (a simple, file-naming-based approximation of "one
# monthly snapshot kept a year" — good enough for the single-host nightly
# cron this is meant to run under; point BACKUP_DIR at off-host/mounted
# storage for the "off-host object storage" half of Phase 0 §26's design).
